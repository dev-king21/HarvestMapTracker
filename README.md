# Harvest Map Tracker

A place tracking app that uses the [google_maps_flutter](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/google_maps_flutter) plugin. 
Keep track of your favorite places, places you've visited, and places you want to go. View details
about these places, show them on a map, and get directions to them.
